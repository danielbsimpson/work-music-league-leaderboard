# 🎵 Daniel's Work Music Leagues

A Streamlit web app for tracking and exploring stats across **work Music League** seasons, split by region.

This project is a fork of [danielbsimpson/music-league-leaderboard](https://github.com/danielbsimpson/music-league-leaderboard) — refer to that repo for full documentation on the underlying stats engine, CSV format reference, tab descriptions, setup instructions, and deployment guidance.

## What's Different From the Original

### 1. Regional data structure

The original repo expects all league folders to sit directly inside `data/`:

```
data/
├── season_1/
└── season_2/
```

This fork adds a **region layer** between `data/` and the individual league folders:

```
data/
├── UK_Leagues/
│   ├── uk_league1/
│   └── uk_league2/
└── US_Leagues/
    └── us_league_current/
```

Each leaf folder still contains the same four CSV exports (`competitors.csv`, `rounds.csv`, `submissions.csv`, `votes.csv`). New regions are auto-discovered — just add a new subfolder under `data/` containing at least one valid league folder.

### 2. Region-aware sidebar

The sidebar now has a two-step selection flow:

| Step | Control | Behaviour |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | **Region** radio | Switches between regional groups (e.g. UK Leagues / US Leagues). Populated automatically from the folders inside `data/`. |
| 2 | **League Selection** radio | Within the chosen region, pick **Single League** (selectbox of available leagues) or **All Leagues (cumulative)** (merges every league in that region into one combined view). |

The original repo's cumulative mode required manually selecting leagues from a multiselect. Here, "All Leagues" always means *all leagues in the current region*, keeping the UI simpler.

### 3. App naming

The app is titled **"Daniel's Work Music Leagues"** rather than the generic "T5 Music League Stats" used in the original. This is reflected in:
- The browser tab title (`page_title`)
- The sidebar header
- The main page heading

### 4. Page caption

The caption beneath the main heading now includes the **selected region name** alongside the usual round/competitor/submission counts, e.g.:

> `UK_Leagues — 2 league(s) · 24 rounds · 10 competitors · 240 submissions · 4,800 points given`

> **League data folders** are auto-discovered from the `data/` directory. Any subfolder inside `data/` that contains all four required CSV files will automatically appear in the sidebar as a selectable league.

---

## Setup & Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A virtual environment **outside** the repo folder (recommended — see note below)

### Install dependencies

```powershell
# Create a virtual environment (Windows) — place it outside the repo
python -m venv "C:\path\to\your\environments\.venv"

# Activate it
"C:\path\to\your\environments\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note on venv location:** Virtual environment `.exe` launcher scripts hardcode the Python path at creation time. If you move the `.venv` folder after creating it, the launchers will break. Always recreate the venv with `python -m venv` at the desired final location.

### Run the app

```powershell
& "C:\path\to\your\environments\.venv\Scripts\streamlit.exe" run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`.

> **Windows note:** If you see emoji rendering issues in the terminal, prefix the command with `$env:PYTHONUTF8=1 ;` before running.

### `requirements.txt`

```
pandas
streamlit
plotly
```

## Adding or Updating League Data

### Adding a new league season

1. Export your league data from [musicleague.com](https://musicleague.com/) (Settings → Export Data).
2. Create a new subfolder inside `data/`, e.g. `data/season_3/`.
3. Place the four exported CSV files inside it:
   ```
   data/
   └── season_3/
       ├── competitors.csv
       ├── rounds.csv
       ├── submissions.csv
       └── votes.csv
   ```
4. Restart (or hot-reload) the app — the new league will appear automatically in the sidebar.

### Cumulative view (multiple leagues)

In the sidebar, switch the radio button from **Single League** to **Cumulative**, then check all the leagues you want to combine. Stats like "Most Improved" automatically scope the first/last 5 rounds *per league* before averaging, so results remain meaningful across seasons.

### Renaming a league

The display name shown in the sidebar is the folder name. Simply rename the folder inside `data/` (e.g. `data/season_1` → `data/Season 1 — The OG Crew`) and restart the app.

## Display Name Formatting

Player names are automatically shortened to a **"First L."** format for cleaner chart labels:

| Raw name in CSV | Displayed as |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `Julie F*******` | `Julie F.` |
| `jonathan.l****` | `Jonathan L.` |
| `rob z*****` | `Rob Z.` |
| `passionloaf` | `Passionloaf` |

Names with a single word (usernames, aliases) are capitalised and left as-is. Names separated by either a space or a dot are both handled.

## How to Expand the App

### Adding a new stat function

1. Open `music_league_stats.py`.
2. Add your function. It should accept `LeagueData` fields as arguments (e.g. `submissions`, `votes`, `competitors`) and return a list of dicts or a scalar.
3. Add the result to `generate_report_text()` if you want it included in the `.txt` download.

### Adding a new tab

1. Create `ui/tab_mynewtab.py` with a `render(data: LeagueData) -> None` function.
2. Import it in `app.py`:
   ```python
   from ui import tab_mynewtab
   ```
3. Add a new tab to the `st.tabs(...)` list in `app.py` and call `tab_mynewtab.render(data)` inside its `with` block.

### Changing the color scheme

Edit `ui/components.py`:

```python
ACCENT = "#1DB954"   # change to any hex color
```

`CHART_BASE` controls the dark chart background. Update `plot_bgcolor` / `paper_bgcolor` there to change the chart canvas color.

## Deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push the project to a **public** (or private, with access granted) GitHub repository.
2. Include a `requirements.txt` in the repo root:
   ```
   pandas
   streamlit
   plotly
   ```
3. Also include your league data folder(s) in the repo, or use [Streamlit secrets](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management) to load data from a remote source.
4. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), click **New app**, point it at your repo and `app.py`.
5. Click **Deploy** — done.

> **Note on data privacy:** If your league data contains real names, be mindful of hosting it in a public repo. The app automatically shortens names to "First L." format in the UI, but the raw CSVs still contain full names. Consider anonymizing the CSVs or using a private repository with restricted access.
